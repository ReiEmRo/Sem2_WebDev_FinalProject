# Final Project of WebDev from Semester 2 at SAIT ITSD
A three-part assignment consisting of a datasets, a quiz, and a car rental page.

## `Datasets`
In this part of the assignment, we were tasked with creating a page that pulls data \
from [Open Calgary](https://data.calgary.ca/) in real time and lists them out based on user search input.

## `Quiz`
This part of the assignment is a simple page that has 5 questions relating to programming.\
The page loads in questions as well as the answers to those questions from an `XML` file through the use of`JavaScript`.
Once the user is finished and submits the quiz, it then brings them to the first screen with their grade printed out.

## `Car Rental`
The Car Rental page consists of two HTML pages, one which is just the index (intended to be a home 
page but was not required for the assignment) and the other which is the main car rental page.\
Using `JavaScript`, we were tasked with reading user search value and finding a corresponding value from the json
document (a list of existing users) provided. The user must select a client account first otherwise interaction
with the other fields are restricted.\
Once a client is selected, they will then be able to select a vehicle as well as additional options. After they checkout,
a receipt is printed out at the bottom with their information as well as the total cost of what they are renting.

# How to Run
Each part runs separately. Using any IDE, run them with a live server.
