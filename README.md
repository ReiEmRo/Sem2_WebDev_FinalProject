# Final Project of WebDev from Semester 2 at SAIT ITSD
A three-part assignment consisting of a datasets, a quiz, and a car rental page.

## `Datasets`
In this part of the assignment, we were tasked with creating a page that pulls data \
from [Open Calgary](https://data.calgary.ca/) in real time and lists them out based on user search input.

## `Quiz`
This part of the assignment is a simple page that has 5 questions relating to programming.\
The page loads in questions as well as the answers to those questions from an `XML` file through the use of`JavaScript`.\
Once the user is finished and submits the quiz, it then brings them to the first screen with their grade printed out.

## `Car Rental`
The Car Rental page consists of two HTML pages, one which is just the index (intended to be a home page but was not required for the assignment)\
and the other which is the main car rental page.\
